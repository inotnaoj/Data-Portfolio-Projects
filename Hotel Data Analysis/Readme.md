In this initiative, we delve into the official COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World In Data](https://website-name.com](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) up to April 21, 2021. Although the data is current until that date, I will soon update it to ensure the most accurate and recent insights.
## Objectives
Our primary goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the this company's revenue, focusing on key variables such as adr, hotel type, localization, meal type, customer type... Through a meticulous analysis, we aim to create meaningful measures and variables that shed light on the current state of the company.
