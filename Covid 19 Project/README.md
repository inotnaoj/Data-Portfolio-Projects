# Covid 19 Project
## Overview
Welcome to a COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis project! In this initiative, we delve into the official COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World In Data](https://website-name.com](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) up to April 21, 2021. Although the data is current until that date, I will soon update it to ensure the most accurate and recent insights.
## Objectives
Our primary goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact globally, focusing on key variables such as case count, death count, hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and vaccinations. Through a meticulous analysis, we aim to create meaningful measures and variables that shed light on the pandemic's nuances within each country and continent.
## Data Source
The raw data, extracted from [Our World In Data](https://website-name.com](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), serves as the backbone of our exploration. This reputable source guarantees the reliability and accuracy of the information, forming the basis for our in-depth analysis.
## Key Features
### Data exploration with SQL
Once we extracted the data, it was uploaded to PostgreSQL with a simple Python script(see files). Skills used in this step: Joins, Temp tables, CTE, Views, Time Series.
### Dashboard creation
Check out this visually appealing and informative [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid19ExploratoryAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=es-ES&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). It offers a user-friendly interface to interact with the data, allowing you to explore various facets of the pandemic effortlessly.
## Future Updates
We acknowledge the dynamic nature of the pandemic and I will try to keep our project up-to-date, ensuring that our analysis reflects the current state of affairs.
