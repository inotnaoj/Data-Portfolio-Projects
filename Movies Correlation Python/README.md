# Movie Features Correlations with Python
### Skills used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, ANOVA, TukeyHSD. Data cleaning and exploration
## Overview
Welcome to this project, where we will explore and analyse data from IMDB movies database. 
## Objectives
Our primary goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of which variables are correlated, and which features have an impact on gross revenue.
## Key Features
### Data exploration and cleaning with Python
We explored the data types (and changed them when needed) and unique values of some of the features. We also looked for duplicated and missing data, and we worked on it in order to get our data ready for further analysis.
We also devided the 'released' feature in 2 new features: country and year.
Once the data was ready, we created a correlation matrix with a heatmap to better understand which numerical features are highly correlated. After that, we created some vizualizations for votes vs gross and buget vs gross for a better understanding of these correlations.
Finally, we assessed if there were any significant differences in gross revenue on the different cualitative features. We did this by running ANOVA tests and Tukey-Kramer posthoc tests. We also looked for the top values of those cualitative features that had productions with higher gross revenues.
